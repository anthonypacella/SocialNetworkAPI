# SocialMedia API

## My Task

My Tast is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I need to use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, I also will need to use the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps.

## User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

## Install, Seed, and Run application

* In order to install all necessary dependancies, please use 'npm install'.
* In order to seed the database, please use 'npm run seed'.
* In order to run the application, please use 'npm start'.

## Mock-Up

The following video shows an example of the application being used from the command line and in Insomnia:

[![A video thumbnail shows the seeding and starting of the application. Then the API functionality is shown in Insomnia](./Assets/Thumbnail.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IW8UFKz0qQgkPpVfFDkoowHZNwB6Wh0V/view?usp=sharing)
